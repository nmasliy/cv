I graduated from college as a software technician. Now I am a 3rd year student at the university in a similar profession. The basis of my knowledge is made up of videos on YouTube and free courses.

### __Self-education__
I learn React for 2 months on this youtube course(contains 100 lessons:) [React-Samurai](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8). 
After 2 months learning React i start practice and create [weather-app](https://github.com/nmasliy/react-weather-app).
I finished this course and continue learning React on other resources.
Besides the framework itself, i learned to work with server(AJAX), promises and other things, which i didn't understand before. I found out about project's architecture

## __English__
My english level is Pre-Intermediate (A2). I try to google, read documentation and use applications only in English.
